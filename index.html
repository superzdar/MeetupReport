                I attended webinar named "Free Frontend Crash Course: HTML & CSS hosted by Jason Humphrey at Thinkful
                Webinar Online San Francisco, CA.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jason started of by describing us how the web works. When you type in a URl, browser sends an http
                request to server and the server sends back the HTML, CSS, Javascript files and browser renders them.
            </p>
            <p>
                He taught us stuff like HTML elements. How there are an opening tag, closing tag and content between
                them. He showed us facebook website without any CSS and how boring was it without any style sheet. Then
                he showed us how to use CSS properly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of the stuff he showed was already discussed in our class. But I was able to refresh my HTML & CSS
                skills that I learned in our class. He also gave some SEO tips that you should only use one H1 element
                in your header. He conveyed that real developers use google a lot and its okay to look up stuff if
                forget something. Overall, it was a great experinece and really enjoyed it.
